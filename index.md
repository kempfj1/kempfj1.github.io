What Software Engineering Means to Me:

```markdown
It seems as though everyone in my family is a genius in their own way,
but my father is a genius in almost every way. He has a degree in 
Aerospace Engineering, Software Engineering, and Electrical Engineering,
so let's just say he has a lot of books about every subject. As a child,
we used to take things apart and try and build other things from the parts
we had disassembled, he would solder every circuit board I would shove at him,
and we would do every "nerdy" activity together, me being the imagination, and
he the one to actually create the things I dreamed up. 

Software Engineering is being able to make the things I dream up myself,
and figuring out how to bring them to life, the imagination just helps
me find things to make.

The Pragmatic Programmer Chapter 1:

```markdown
While I can appreciate the beginning of this chapter telling me to be 
accountable for myself, I think they might have put this lecture in the
wrong book. It probably belongs in a school handbook or a self-help
book, and seems superfluous, but maybe someone out ther got something
out of it, but I doubt it.

# Important:
**Entropy is a term from physics that refers to the amount of "disorder" 
in a system. Unfortunately, the laws of thermodynamics guarantee that the
entropy in the universe tends toward a maximum. When disorder increases in 
software, programmers call it "software rot."**

**Know when to stop: Don't spoil a perfectly good program by overembellishment 
and over-refinement. Move on, and let your code stand in its own right for a while.
It may not be perfect. Don't worry: it could never be perfect.**


In conclusion, this book is not at all what I was expecting. I was
expecting something along the lines of "this is how you do this"
and "here is a good program for doing this" but seem to be face-to-face
with a "programmer's self help book," which isn't horrible, I suppose.
I enjoy the real life scenarios to make something 2D seem 3D, and more
relatable in content.
