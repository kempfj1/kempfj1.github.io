What Software Engineering Means to Me:

```markdown
It seems as though everyone in my family is a genius in their own way,
but my father is a genius in almost every way. He has a degree in 
Aerospace Engineering, Software Engineering, and Electrical Engineering,
so let's just say he has a lot of books about every subject. As a child,
we used to take things apart and try and build other things from the parts
we had disassembled, he would solder every circuit board I would shove at him,
and we would do every "nerdy" activity together, me being the imagination, and
he the one to actually create the things I dreamed up. 

Software Engineering is being able to make the things I dream up myself,
and figuring out how to bring them to life, the imagination just helps
me find things to make.

The Pragmatic Programmer Chapter 1:

While I can appreciate the beginning of this chapter telling me to be 
accountable for myself, I think they might have put this lecture in the
wrong book. It probably belongs in a school handbook or a self-help
book, and seems superfluous, but maybe someone out ther got something
out of it, but I doubt it.

# Important:
**Entropy is a term from physics that refers to the amount of "disorder" 
in a system. Unfortunately, the laws of thermodynamics guarantee that the
entropy in the universe tends toward a maximum. When disorder increases in 
software, programmers call it "software rot."**

**Know when to stop: Don't spoil a perfectly good program by overembellishment 
and over-refinement. Move on, and let your code stand in its own right for a while.
It may not be perfect. Don't worry: it could never be perfect.**


In conclusion, this book is not at all what I was expecting. I was
expecting something along the lines of "this is how you do this"
and "here is a good program for doing this" but seem to be face-to-face
with a "programmer's self help book," which isn't horrible, I suppose.
I enjoy the real life scenarios to make something 2D seem 3D, and more
relatable in content.

The Pragmatic Programmer Chapter 2:

```markdown
Firstly, starting off a chapter with a Star Trek reference will always have my 
attention, so this must be a good one.

One of the more interesting subjects in this chapter is the idea of programmers 
constantly "cleaning" code, and bug fixes being a constant task. I don't
have much experience with debugging except those occasional updates I get
on the apps on my phone. These updates, I know, are worked on between each 
update, but it does make me wonder: at what point does an update become so 
necessary that the developers push it to their (sometimes) millions of users?
This answer may vary from person to person, but if the work is never done in
debugging and updating, when do they decide to take a break and send out what
they've accomplished? It's like counting to infinity: why can't I wrap my brain
around the fact that it cannot end.

This whole chapter has been mostly about clean code: documentation, lack of 
repeats, traceability, and reversibility. These things should be engraved in 
my brain by now, but the examples were immensely helpful in showing real-world
reasons to justify why I should do it, I always have, but I'm glad to have a real reason,
and not just a teacher telling me that I need to do it just because I do.

Prototyping describes my programming experience really well:
"Prototyping is a learning experience. Its value lies not in the code produced, 
but in the lessons learned."


**Fun Class Note:**
Software Development Cycle:
1. Plan
2. Design
3. Build
4. Test
5. Deliver
6. Maintain
7. Retire

The Pragmatic Programmer Chapter 3:
```markdown
Things I absorbed:
1. Plain Text is good, it will outlive me
2. Code generators are code that generates other code (which isn't a definition, at all).
3. Debugging is hard for really arrogant people, and probably me.
4. Use source code control or die, basically.

I am not entirely in love with this book mainly because I have yet to even
attempt most of these things, and I am not understanding them by reading
"what not to do." I know these are mostly just suggestions on how to "act"
while programming, but they're preaching to a brick wall, because I do not/
have not done most of these things. 

Frequently, the book talks about reversibility and how important it is,
but lacks information on how to literally accomplish that. It's like if the
bible had just been like "BE A GOOD PERSON" and not had a list of things not 
to do (aka the 10 Commandments)(No I'm not religious but this is the simplest anology
I could think of).

The one section that actually did make some sense was the suggestion to become 
extremely proficient in one editor, like Intellij. Every day I try to find more
shortcuts in the application, making code more simple and quicker to accomplish.
I'm still not very proficient in the program, but the more I use it the better
I get.
